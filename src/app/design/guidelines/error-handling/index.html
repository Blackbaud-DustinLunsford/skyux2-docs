<stache-page-anchor>Style and tone</stache-page-anchor>
	
	<p>Error and warning message wording should be short and succinct and use a conversational, human-voice approach. When possible, try to not only explain why the error/warning is occurring, but offer a solution. Use the <a routerLink="/components/error">Error</a> component to provide a consistent user experience with error messaging.</p>
	<p>Errors can frustrate a user and sometimes indicate a serious problem, so be thoughtful and helpful with the wording. Limit the use of please/sorry, be careful how you use can't/don't (try to avoid you can't or you don't), and avoid humor.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Accessibility guidelines</stache-page-anchor>	
	
	<p>Don't rely on a single sensory characteristic of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound when describing an error or offering a solution for an error. Using "above" and "below" is fine when referencing content in the appropriate reading order for the language used as long as the reference isn't ambiguous.</p>

			<p>There are a variety of page-level errors that can happen, usually due to a system failure rather than a user action. The <a routerLink="/components/error">Error</a> component has default content applicable to most scenarios, although the content can be customized if it needs to be more precise or prescriptive. </p>
