  To serve in Firefox, you must add a certificate exception. To add the exception through the browser, run <stache-code>skyux serve -b firefox -l local</stache-code> to launch the local URL (or <stache-code>skyux serve -l local</stache-code> if Firefox is the default browser). When the browser displays a warning that the connection is not secure, click <strong>Advanced</strong> and then click <strong>Add Exception</strong>. On the Add Security Exception screen, click <strong>Confirm Security Exception</strong> to add the exception and serve the SPA.
